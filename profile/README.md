### 🌿 About

Heavenkey is a decentralized protocol that protects digital continuity.  
It ensures that what we build online — our creations, values, and commitments —  
remains meaningful and traceable over time.  

Heavenkey doesn’t seek to store wealth.  
It safeguards purpose, transforming dormant capital into new opportunities  
for those we trust and for the public good.

### ✨ What it embodies

- **Continuity with care** — Every plan is a quiet promise that keeps value alive.  
- **Privacy-first** — Heirs and data remain off-chain, encrypted, and protected.  
- **Autonomy** — Fully non-custodial and automated on Ethereum.  
- **Ethical fallback** — Unclaimed value sustains education, open research, and public goods.
