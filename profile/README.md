### 🌿 About

Heavenkey is a decentralized protocol designed to protect the **continuity of what has been built**.  
It ensures that every creation, decision, and intention we leave in the digital world  
can follow its natural course — executed faithfully, securely, and with dignity.  

At its heart lies the **Heavenkey EFM™ – Ethical Fallback Mechanism**:  
a self-executing path that honors the creator’s will when human presence is no longer active.  
If no one steps forward to continue, the protocol itself fulfills that final act of coherence —  
transforming what remains into purpose, preserving the spirit of the origin.  

Heavenkey does not ask for control — it restores meaning.  
It does not store wealth — it protects intent.  
It does not end — it continues.

### ✨ Core Principles

- **Continuity with care** — Every plan is a quiet promise that keeps value alive.  
- **Privacy-first** — Heirs and data remain off-chain, encrypted, and protected.  
- **Autonomy** — Fully non-custodial and automated through Ethereum’s logic.  
- **Ethical Fallback Mechanism (Heavenkey EFM™)** — Ensures that every unclaimed legacy completes its journey according to the owner’s declared intent.
